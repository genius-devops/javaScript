/**
 * Function accepts parameters, let's send an integer to our function and print it!
Implemente a while loop to call a function detonation in...X secondes.
Your loop will stop at 0. You need to consider 10 included, but 0 is not.
(Don't forget to decrement the index ;-))
Replace/Complete the following code.
(The XX is what you need to replace)
